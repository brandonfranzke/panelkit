# PanelKit - Next Development Steps

This document outlines the next steps for developing PanelKit after the initial implementation.

## Current Status

The current implementation provides:

- Basic project structure with a modular, event-driven architecture
- Working platform abstraction with trait-based downcasting
- Simple SDL2-based demo page implementation (without LVGL)
- Mock platform drivers for testing
- Direct SDL2 driver for desktop simulation
- Containerized build environment with cross-compilation support
- macOS native build support without X11/XQuartz dependencies
- Working pub/sub event system
- Basic UI rendering with SDL2
- Touch event handling for interactive UI elements
- Transfer script for deploying to target devices

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete and Test SDL2-based UI**
   - Enhance the current `SimpleDemoPage` implementation
   - Add more interactive elements
   - Improve touch event handling and gesture recognition
   - Test thoroughly on desktop simulator

2. **Develop Target Platform Driver**
   - Create framebuffer-based display driver for Raspberry Pi
   - Implement touch input driver for Waveshare screen
   - Test on actual target hardware
   - Optimize rendering performance

3. **Revisit LVGL Integration**
   - With better understanding of architecture, attempt LVGL integration again
   - Resolve compilation and binding issues
   - Create proper configuration approach
   - Transition UI from direct SDL2 to LVGL components

## Medium-Term Tasks

1. **UI Component System**
   - Develop a comprehensive set of UI widgets (buttons, labels, etc.)
   - Create layout system for arranging widgets
   - Implement theming support

2. **Additional Pages**
   - Create a settings page
   - Implement page transitions and animations
   - Add gesture navigation between pages

3. **Network Integration**
   - Implement network status monitoring
   - Add API client capabilities
   - Create network configuration UI

## Long-Term Considerations

1. **Power Management**
   - Implement display dimming/sleep
   - Add variable refresh rates based on activity
   - Optimize polling intervals

2. **Hardware Expansion**
   - Design abstraction for additional hardware interfaces
   - Create plugin system for new hardware capabilities
   - Add configuration UI for hardware settings

3. **Testing and CI/CD**
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Set up automated testing workflow
   - Create installer/deployment scripts

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the established architectural patterns
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Document all public APIs
- Make regular, incremental commits
- Use the containerized build environment for all development
