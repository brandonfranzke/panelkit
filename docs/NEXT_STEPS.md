# PanelKit Next Steps

This document outlines the future development roadmap for PanelKit.

## Current Status

The current implementation provides:

- Unified platform driver interface with trait-based abstraction
- Working SDL2-based simulation environment for development
- Safe type-based downcasting for platform-specific features
- Robust error handling with proper context and recovery
- Event-driven architecture with pub/sub messaging
- UI manager with page navigation and rendering
- Touch event handling and basic interactivity
- State management foundation with serialization support
- Containerized build environment for cross-compilation

## Short-Term Goals

### 1. Complete Platform Support

- **Framebuffer Driver**: Implement a direct framebuffer driver for Raspberry Pi
  - Linux framebuffer (/dev/fb0) integration
  - Hardware-accelerated rendering where possible
  - DRM/KMS support for modern displays

- **Touch Input**: Implement direct touchscreen input handling
  - Linux input event handling (/dev/input/*)
  - Basic gesture detection
  - Touch calibration

### 2. UI Enhancements

- **Widget Library**: Create reusable UI components
  - Buttons, sliders, toggles
  - Text labels and input fields
  - Container layouts

- **Multi-page Navigation**: Implement page navigation system
  - Swipe-based page transitions
  - Navigation history
  - Animated transitions

### 3. State Management Improvements

- **Persistent Storage**: Implement full state persistence
  - File-based storage for settings
  - Efficient serialization/deserialization
  - State change notifications

## Medium-Term Goals

### 1. Performance Optimizations

- **Rendering Optimizations**
  - Dirty region tracking
  - Double buffering
  - Render caching

- **Memory Management**
  - Resource pooling
  - Lifecycle management
  - Memory usage monitoring

### 2. Extended Input Support

- **Advanced Gesture Recognition**
  - Multi-touch gestures
  - Pinch-to-zoom
  - Long press and drag

- **Alternative Input Methods**
  - Hardware button support
  - Rotary encoder integration
  - Remote control options

### 3. Network Features

- **Connectivity Management**
  - WiFi configuration
  - Network status monitoring
  - Connection recovery

- **Remote Management**
  - Web-based administration
  - Remote monitoring
  - OTA updates

## Long-Term Vision

### 1. Extensibility

- **Plugin System**
  - Dynamic page loading
  - Extension API
  - Third-party component support

### 2. Multi-Device Integration

- **Device Synchronization**
  - State sharing between devices
  - Distributed UI capabilities
  - Central management

### 3. Advanced Graphics

- **Rich Visual Elements**
  - Charts and data visualization
  - SVG rendering
  - Animation framework

## Implementation Priorities

For the immediate development cycle, priority should be given to:

1. **Framebuffer Driver Implementation**: Essential for actual embedded deployment
2. **Widget Library Development**: Necessary for creating useful interfaces
3. **State Persistence**: Critical for maintaining application state

## Development Process

- **Test-Driven Development**: Add comprehensive test suite
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation
- **Code Quality**: Maintain clean architecture and proper error handling
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Monitor resource usage and responsiveness

By focusing on these areas, PanelKit will evolve from a proof-of-concept into a production-ready embedded UI system suitable for a variety of touch-based applications.
