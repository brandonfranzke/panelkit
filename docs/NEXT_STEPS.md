# PanelKit - Next Development Steps

This document outlines the next steps for developing PanelKit after the initial proof-of-life implementation.

## Current Status

The current implementation provides:

- Basic project structure with a modular, event-driven architecture
- Mock platform drivers for testing
- Simple "Hello World" page implementation
- Containerized build environment (not yet fully tested)
- Pub/sub event system

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Test Build System**
   - Build the project locally using the Docker container
   - Verify that the application runs correctly
   - Test cross-compilation (may require additional setup)

2. **Implement LVGL Integration**
   - Add proper LVGL bindings
   - Create real display driver for both SDL2 (simulator) and framebuffer (target)
   - Implement proper touch event handling

3. **Enhance State Management**
   - Complete the state persistence implementation
   - Add state change events
   - Implement configuration loading from YAML

## Medium-Term Tasks

1. **UI Component System**
   - Develop a comprehensive set of UI widgets (buttons, labels, etc.)
   - Create layout system for arranging widgets
   - Implement theming support

2. **Additional Pages**
   - Create a settings page
   - Implement page transitions and animations
   - Add gesture navigation between pages

3. **Network Integration**
   - Implement network status monitoring
   - Add API client capabilities
   - Create network configuration UI

## Long-Term Considerations

1. **Power Management**
   - Implement display dimming/sleep
   - Add variable refresh rates based on activity
   - Optimize polling intervals

2. **Hardware Expansion**
   - Design abstraction for additional hardware interfaces
   - Create plugin system for new hardware capabilities
   - Add configuration UI for hardware settings

3. **Testing and CI/CD**
   - Add unit and integration tests
   - Set up automated testing workflow
   - Create installer/deployment scripts

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the established architectural patterns
- Maintain clean separation of concerns
- Document all public APIs
- Make regular, incremental commits
- Use the containerized build environment for all development
