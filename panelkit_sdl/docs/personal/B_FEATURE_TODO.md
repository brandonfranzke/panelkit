For "api": how about for each "services" including a (optional) "headers" section -- may be needed for apis with odd (or non-standard requirements for headers) as well as an (optoonal) meta (or "data"? section) -- which will be values that the api can access "as needed" (e.g. keys, tokens, extra fields) -- this can be offloaded to custom processing in the service handler -- so there does not need to be a blind mapper.

Rotation (handled in layout refactor)
