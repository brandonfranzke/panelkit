Still all white -- what if we focus (maybe what you are doing now) -- on something we think _should_ be working, it sounds like you believe that the   rectangles _should_ be working (confirm) -- and that if there is a problem, it might be text rendering -- please correct if I am wrong. If that _is_ the case then lets go deep and figure out why the thing we expect to work isnt working -- for instance, lets JUST get the button/background on the first page working. (text or not).                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Remember: we can always return to this checkpoint (and report findings back in time to do things "correct" the next time through)

###

Correct, note that the "dyanmic" sizing is important -- I will be changing to a new screen in the future (different resolution) so buttons sizes, etc should be reasonably dynamic.

So go through (1-by-1, with feedback; or all at once, with feedback -- if you think you will be successful).

###

Review the current code state -- does it show signs of patch-chasing (fixes up fixes to chase bugs) or does it mostly still have the strong software engineering approach that we are aiming for.

Are there any components/systems/segments that you would consider "tightly coupled" but that should not be?
