# Planning Documents

This directory contains forward-looking plans, architectural thoughts, and design proposals.

⚠️ **Important**: These are plans and ideas, not current implementation. Check main documentation for what's actually built.

## Current Documents

- **ERROR_UI_FUTURE.md** - Future plans for error UI improvements

## Guidelines

1. Clearly mark document status (DRAFT, PROPOSED, APPROVED)
2. Date documents and major revisions
3. Move to main docs once implemented
4. Archive or remove abandoned plans
