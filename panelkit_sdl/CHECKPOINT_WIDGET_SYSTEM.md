# Widget System Checkpoint - December 2024

## Current State Summary

This checkpoint captures the widget system after significant fixes to event handling, positioning, and gesture support. The system is functional but still has some dependencies on legacy code.

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Event System Fixes
- **Problem**: All buttons were reporting the same event data (button=0, text="Change Text Color")
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues:
  - Widget manager was clearing PRESSED state before button could check it
  - Child widgets (text) were intercepting button clicks
  - Event propagation was broadcasting to all widgets
- **Solutions**:
  - Modified button event handler to check PRESSED state before calling default handler
  - Fixed widget_hit_test to prefer interactive widgets (buttons) over passive children
  - Fixed timing in widget_manager to clear PRESSED state after event handling

### 2. Child Widget Positioning
- **Problem**: Text widgets were using absolute positions instead of relative to parent
- **Solution**: Changed all child widgets to use widget_set_relative_bounds
- **Additional Fix**: Added widget_update_child_bounds() to recursively update positions when parents move

### 3. Swipe Gesture Support
- **Problem**: No swipe support in widget system
- **Solution**: Implemented swipe handling in page_manager_widget
- **Issues Fixed**:
  - Normalized pixel offsets to page-width units (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Fixed swipe threshold calculations
  - Added proper drag state tracking

## Files Modified

### Core Widget System
- `src/ui/widget.c` - Fixed hit testing and added child bounds updating
- `src/ui/widget.h` - Added widget_update_child_bounds declaration
- `src/ui/widget_manager.c` - Fixed event timing issues
- `src/ui/widgets/button_widget.c` - Fixed event handling order
- `src/ui/widgets/page_manager_widget.c` - Added swipe gesture support
- `src/ui/widget_integration.c` - Fixed button text positioning and event data

### Documentation
- `TECH_DEBT.md` - Documented issue #21 and other architectural issues
- `WIDGET_EVENT_ISSUES.md` - Detailed analysis of event system problems
- `LEGACY_UI.md` - Complete reference of legacy UI behavior

## Known Issues Remaining

### Issue #21: WIDGET_RENDER Mode Still Depends on Legacy Systems
**Status**: ~70% Complete

**Completed**:
- Separate rendering paths for widget vs legacy mode
- Widget system reads from state store instead of globals
- Independent event handling for widgets

**Still TODO**:
1. Widget buttons still update global variables (should only update state store)
2. Page transitions publish events for legacy system to handle
3. State syncing (widget_integration_sync_state_to_globals) still runs in widget mode
4. Event system has unclear separation between widget and legacy events

### Minor Issues:
1. Swipe gestures need refinement (sometimes "jumpy")
2. Some duplicate event handling
3. Page indicators not implemented in widget system
4. Debug overlay not implemented in widget system

## How to Test

### Basic Functionality Test:
```bash
# Run in widget mode
WIDGET_RENDER=1 ./build/host/panelkit

# Test these actions:
1. Click "Change Color" button on page 0 - should transition to page 1
2. Click color buttons on page 1 - should change background color
3. Swipe left/right - should change pages
4. Click "Go to Page 1" - should return to page 0
5. Click "Exit App" - should quit
```

### Event System Test:
```bash
# Run with debug output to verify correct event data
WIDGET_RENDER=1 ./build/host/panelkit 2>&1 | grep -E "Button.*publishing:|Widget button click handler:"
```

## Next Steps to Complete #21

1. **Isolate Widget Mode State Updates**:
   ```c
   // In button click handlers, check if in widget mode
   if (getenv("WIDGET_RENDER")) {
       // Update only state store, not globals
       state_store_set(...);
   } else {
       // Legacy behavior
       global_var = new_value;
   }
   ```

2. **Remove Legacy Event Publishing in Widget Mode**:
   ```c
   // In widget_page_transition_handler
   if (!getenv("WIDGET_RENDER")) {
       // Only publish legacy events if not in widget mode
       event_publish(integration->event_system, "system.page_transition", ...);
   }
   ```

3. **Disable State Syncing in Widget Mode**:
   ```c
   // In app.c main loop
   if (!use_widget_rendering) {
       widget_integration_sync_state_to_globals(...);
   }
   ```

## Code Architecture Notes

### Widget Event Flow:
1. SDL Event â†’ widget_manager_handle_event
2. Widget manager finds hit widget via widget_hit_test
3. Sets PRESSED state on hit widget
4. Calls widget_handle_event on root (propagates to all widgets)
5. Button widget checks PRESSED state and fires button_widget_click
6. Click publishes event with button-specific data
7. Event system notifies subscribers

### Page Management:
- PageManagerWidget handles all page transitions
- Pages are positioned horizontally (x = page_index * screen_width)
- Swipe gestures update transition_offset (normalized -1.0 to 1.0)
- Animation system smoothly transitions between pages

## Recovery Instructions

If you need to revert to this checkpoint:
```bash
git checkout [this commit hash]
make clean && make host
```

The widget system at this checkpoint is functional with:
- Working button clicks with correct event data
- Page transitions via buttons
- Basic swipe gesture support
- Proper text alignment within buttons
- State store integration

The main limitation is continued dependency on some legacy systems, which is the focus of the remaining work on issue #21.
